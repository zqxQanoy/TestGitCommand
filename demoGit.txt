1.第一次提交 http://blog.csdn.net/hanhailong726188/article/details/46738929

$ git pull --rebase origin master
From https://github.com/zqxQanoy/TestGitCommand
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: first commit

3.此时我也在本地进行了修改

$ git push -u origin master
To https://github.com/zqxQanoy/TestGitCommand.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/zqxQanoy/TestGitCommand.g         it'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
